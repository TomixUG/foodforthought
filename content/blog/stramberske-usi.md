Štramberské uši are traditional pastry from Štramberk, town located ca. 12 kilometers from Frenštát pod Radhoštěm. The most interesting part about them is their history. Štramberské uši have been baked in Štramberk nearly 800 years and the name means literally ‘Štramberk ears’.

In the 13th century Tatars invaded eastern and central Europe, and plundered everything they came across. In year 1241 they came also to Štramberk, and tried to conquer the town. Luckily, it started to rain, people dug up pond dams, and Tatars, not awaiting this, got drowned. Old Tatar tradition was to send salted, cut ears or hands of their victims to their khan. According to this tradition, and in honor of Štramberk’s victory people bake Štramberské uši till today.

Štramberské uši are basically ear-shaped, sweet pastry. The taste can be compared to gingerbread, since the dough contains spice like e.g. cinammon, cloves, nutmeg, or star anise. Other ingredients are flour, eggs, sugar, honey or caramel. Of course, the exact recipes are secret. Traditionally, Štramberské uši are served, just how they are, without any filling or icing. But today you can buy them in different flavours, or filled e.g. with whipped cream. These days there are only 8 producers who have license to bake original Štramberské uši. Every year takes place a competition about who makes the best Štramberské uši. And fun fact – the diameter of the biggest ‘Štramberk ear’ was 195 cm!
