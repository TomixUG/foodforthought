Sleep is a necessity for our life. We spend almost one-third of our life in sleep. Our sleeping patterns influence our mental health, our behaviours, our memory, and creativity. For example, the range for an adult is 6-8 hours per night. For teens, it is 8-10 hours per night. Babies, it is 17 hours per night. But this information might not be for everybody. We all have different genetics and type of styles we live by so someone may thrive on a different sleep pattern than the other. And because of that, I made a list of things that could help you to set your healthy sleeping pattern.

**1. Regularity**

Our brains work best under the conditions of regularity. So, if you go to sleep and wake up at the same hour every day, it could improve your sleeping pattern.

**2. Temperature**

Keep it cool. If you want to initiate a good sleep and stay asleep your body will need to drop its core temperature about one degree Celsius. The best temperature for sleep is about 18 degrees Celsius.

**3. Darkness**

Darkness releases a hormone called melatonin, which helps to regulate the healthy timing of our sleep. Try to stay away from your mobile phone and computer screen at least one hour before sleep. You can also use blackout sheets or sleep masks so it will be easier for you to release more melatonin.

**4. Walk it out.**

If you have woken up or you cannot fall asleep, do not spend in your bed more than 25 minutes. Go do something else. Only return when you are sleepy, and your brain will relearn that association. Whenever you will go to bed, it will be easier for you to fall asleep.

**5. Monitor alcohol & caffeine.**

Try to stay away from caffeine in the evening. Also, try not to go to bed too drunk.

**6. Wind down routine.**

Create a routine that will make you feel relaxed and will help you to go to sleep.
