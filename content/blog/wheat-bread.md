In this video we successfully made bread.

Baking bread seems a bit intimidating to most of us without much baking experience. However, it did prove to be a lot more time-consuming and a lot less difficult than we originally anticipated.

### Ingredients:
<u>for the leaven:</u>
- 1 Tbs of sourdough
- 150g of water
- 200g of rye flour

<u>for the dough:</u>
- leaven
- 300g of wheat flour
- 170g of water
- 12g of salt
- 4g of cumin

&plus; a cup of water (for the oven to create steam)

Bake at 250°C for 15 minutes, then turn the heat down to 220°C for about 25 minutes.
