In this video, we made rye bread. A healthy addition to anyone’s diet.

I’d say it turned out pretty good!

### Ingredients:
<u>for the leaven:</u>

- 1Tbs of sourdough
- 200g of water
- 200g of rye flour

<u>for the dough:</u>

- leaven
- 300g of rye flour
- 300g of water
- 1Tbs of rice syrup
- 12g of salt
- seeds of our choice (It is also good to crush some of them up and add them in)

&plus; a cup of water (for the oven to create steam), butter (for the form)

Bake at 250°C for 15 minutes, dump the bread out of its form and bake at 220°C for about 25 more minutes.
