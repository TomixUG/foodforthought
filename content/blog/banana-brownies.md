### <u>Ingredients:</u>
- 100 g spelt flour (Spelt flour contains a higher amount of fibre, vitamins and minerals)
- 25 g protein (if you do not have it, you can use spelt flour instead of the protein powder)
- 50 g cacao
- 1 tsp (teaspoon) baking powder
- 4 bananas
- 4 eggs

Note - you do not need to add sugar to the dough because it is sweet enough thanks to the bananas

### <u>Directions:</u>
1. Heat the oven to 180 degrees C.
2. Mix all the ingredients in a bowl.
3. Pour the liquid dough on a baking pan (around 28 x 20 cm).
4. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven.
5. After removing from the oven let the brownies cool down.
6. After a while, you can enjoy the tasty brownies.

### <u>TIP:</u>
If you want, you can decorate your brownie with fruit. Before I put it to the oven, I used frozen raspberries.
