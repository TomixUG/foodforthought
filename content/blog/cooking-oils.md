There are plenty of options when it comes to choosing which type of cooking oil to use. 

But which oil is the for you? That depends on the type of cooking. Also it's important to consider oil's **smoke point**, that's the point when oil starts burning and smoking.

In this article, we will show you a few cooking oils and their important properties.

### Olive oil

Olive oil is one of the most versatile and healthy oils. The best type is **extra virgin**. Extra virgin olive oil contains a large number of monounsaturated fats and some polyunsaturated fatty acids, which can improve your heart health. According to research, it lowers rates of cardiovascular problems, which include heart attack, stroke, and death from heart disease.

Olive oil has a relatively low smoke point compared to other oils, making it best for cooking on medium-low heat.

### Canola oil

Canola oil comes from a rapeseed plant. It's high in monounsaturated fat and moderately high in polyunsaturated fat. Canola oil contains the least amount of saturated fats of any vegetable oil.

It has a high smoke point, so high-heat cooking is not a problem.

### Sunflower oil

Sunflower oil is high in vitamin E. It has a high smoke point and it doesn't have a strong flavor. It also contains a lot of omega-6 fatty acids. It's important to keep in mind that consuming too many omega-6 fatty acids can lead to excess inflammation in the body, so moderation is the key.

### Vegetable oil

It's a type of oil that's made from oilseeds, legumes, nuts, or flesh of some fruits.

Vegetable oil has the highest levels of polyunsaturated fats compared to olive, coconut, and canola oil.

They are refined and processed, which means that they lack flavor and nutrients.

Vegetable oils are not stable when used at high temperatures. They have a low level of antioxidants and can release harmful compounds when heated.

### Avocado oil

It's unrefined like extra virgin olive oil but has a higher smoke point. One of the advantages is its lack of flavor.

Avocado oil contains both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids.

It's pretty expensive.

### Coconut oil

Depending on who you ask, coconut oil should be avoided or used in moderation. The main source of concern is the high saturated fat content of coconut oil. Some experts say that replacing foods high in saturated fat with healthier options can lower cholesterol levels and improve blood lipid profiles.

It's not a problem to use coconut oil at a very high temperature, since they have a higher smoke point.
