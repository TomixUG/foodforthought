## How to process seasonal vegetables and fruits? 
There are times when there is less food and there is no shortage at other times of the year. Especially in autumn and winter, it is ideal to process **fresh root vegetables**, respectively stored from local farmers and farmers. Fortunately, winter vegetables have an inexhaustible number of uses - you can cook rich and delicious soups and creams, thick sauces and colorful roasted salads. From stored apples and pears you will prepare great warm desserts such as puddings, strudels and crumbs and will enliven the breakfast in fresh and stewed form. The autumn flood of pumpkins is ideal to keep in the form of **cooked puree** for baking and cooking in other months. 

In the spring and summer, it is necessary to think ahead to keep all your tastes. Markets and gardens usually overflow with a variety of ingredients that are often not consumed as main courses and fresh, so it's time for our grandmothers' skills and knowledge.  

In particular, **fruit offers a wide range of preservation for the winter:** make jams, fruit purees and compotes, bake roasted tea supplies, make fruit and herb syrups and especially freeze berries - in winter you will appreciate them for morning porridge or yoghurt and cakes. From the excess vegetables, you will benefit from prepared ketchups and vegetable mixtures - for example, lecho in a glass, which you can easily add later, for example, eggs before serving. A great way to use herbs is also a variety of green pesto, which you create in a blender in a few minutes and save you when you need to prepare a quick meal in a hurry. If you have a food dryer at home, you can quickly and efficiently dry the summer and spring portion and store it in closable dark jars so that the ingredients do not get wet. But drying in the sun will serve just as well. 

**Store** food supplies **best in the dark and cool** - both the cellar and the pantry or other cold part of the house will serve well. It is best to consume frozen food within a few months, cooked glasses will last for several years, but it is good to check them regularly and always consume the oldest dates.
