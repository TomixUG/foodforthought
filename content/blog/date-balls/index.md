Date balls were all the rage in the health world a couple of years ago and they’ve stood the test of time… for good reason! They’re super simple to make, the perfect meal prep recipe and can be enjoyed for breakfast, a snack or dessert! 

While dates are basically dried fruit and relatively high in sugar, they are a natural sweetener. So they offer a great way to add sweetness without any sugar. Because they are high in fiber, they slow down your digestion and help prevent blood sugar levels from spiking too high. That means you get a sweet treat that gives you lasting energy, not a sugar rush. 

Dates are an important source of carbohydrates, vitamin A and vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, B9, E and K. They contain 23 amino acids and a relatively large amount of minerals such as potassium, chlorine, phosphorus and calcium, as well as trace elements copper, manganese and zinc. Fresh dates also contain vitamin C, dried dates iron.

### Benefits of other ingredients that you can add to the balls: 

- **Coconut** is high in antioxidants so it’s good for fighting disease. But it’s also high in saturated-fats, so just be mindful of how much you use. 

- **Sunflower** seeds have very low cholesterol and sodium levels and thus protect your heart. These seeds are a good source of vitamin B6, B9, thiamine, magnesium, copper, phosphorus, manganese and selenium and are rich in vitamin E (alpha tocopherol). Sunflower is also very good for digestion and brain health. 

- **Flaxseed** is a superfood. It is high in B and E vitamins. It is a great source of minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, selenium or zinc. One third of the seeds are omega-3 fatty acids. It has a relatively high content of fiber and protein. Omega-3 fatty acids have a positive effect on blood cholesterol levels and brain and heart activity. The high fiber content benefits our digestion and oxidants rid the body of harmful substances. A substance called lignin (a type of fiber) generally helps the body fight diabetes or kidney problems. The anti-inflammatory effect of flax is also important. 

- **Almonds** are rich in proteins and nutrients. However, nuts are generally known to be effective in reducing appetite, supporting heart function, and even preventing neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disease. In addition, almonds contain manganese, which is important for proper bone development and quality as well as blood pressure regulation. 

- **Sesame seeds** are a good source of healthy fats, proteins, B vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants and other useful plant compounds. Regular consumption, ideally a handful a day, can help control blood sugar levels, fight arthritic pain and lower blood cholesterol levels. 

- **Pumpkin seeds** contain manganese, tryptophan, magnesium, copper, phosphorus, zinc, iron, proteins, omega acids and also minor amounts of B vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, B12) and vitamin A. Pumpkin seeds also contain phytosterol, which is an organic compound that is also healthy. 

- **Cinnamon** has a beneficial effect on digestion, removes stomach pain and prevents stomach ulcers. In addition, it helps with flatulence and diarrhea, relieves bloating and improves appetite. Cinnamon prevents blood clots from forming because it has the ability to dilute blood. Overall, it also helps blood circulation and heart health. 

- **Lemons** mainly contain large amounts of vitamin C, flavonoids, important minerals and acids. They also have strong antiseptic and, thanks to flavonoids, anti-cancer effects, detoxify the body, support metabolism, increase vascular flexibility. 

- **Cocoa** contains a lot of valuable substances, vitamins, minerals that help against fatigue, increased fever, emaciation, sore throat, heart problems, anemia, intestinal and kidney problems or respiratory problems. Cocoa also helps prevent the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, ie bad cholesterol by free radicals. It has an anti-inflammatory effect.  It contains the stimulant, which is stimulating, phenylethylamine - helps with depression, and tryptophan, otherwise called a good mood hormone.
