### <u>Directions:</u>
1. We preheat an oven for 200°C. We spread the dough and cut squares.
2. We put squares on a baking paper. We indicate on them a frame with a round knife. Then we put them into a fridge for 15 minutes.

3. We whisk the egg yolk with the cream. We put out squares from the fridge and put fruit into a smaller square. We brush the edges with a yolk mixture and sprinkle with a little sugar crystal. We bake it for about 15 minutes.
