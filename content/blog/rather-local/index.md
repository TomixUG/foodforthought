### Better quality
A lot of consumers fail to realize, just how large the quality gap between seasonal local products and imported goods tends to be. Which is a shame. Consuming local fruits like cherries, blueberries, apricots and so on doesn’t only taste good, but also gives us vast amounts of health benefits.

The Czech Republic is among the top 3 countries in the EU, with the least amount of chemistry used on crops. Which mostly includes excluding the harmful treatments of fruit. Of course, these harmful substances are highly controlled, however traces of them remain on plants we eat every day.

The Czech Republic is also among the world’s finest of crop breeding. The prime example being cherries. So simply put, eating what we have here lets us enjoy more of the distinct flavour it naturally has. Overall, giving it a better taste.

### Eco-friendly
As we all know, making anything travel leaves an inevitable strain on our environment. Most crops shipped within Europe are transported via trucks. That lifts the amount of carbon pollution by a considerable amount. Another great benefit of locally sourced goods is the reduction of risks connected to droughts. Such as erosion, floods and so on.

### Tradition
And inevitably, the shift towards imported goods makes it hard for a lot of small local businesses to compete. So, deciding to consume what we naturally have in our country not only helps keep the deep-rooted traditions of crop farming thriving, but also gives us a chance to be nicer to our bodies. Giving it what naturally grows in the area we live in.
