6. Lay the bars on a baking paper. You can put the bars close to each other. They don‘t have a tendency to melt.
7. Bake for about 15 minutes, until the bars are pinkish.

These bars are delicious. In addition the preparation is easy peasy lemon squeezy. They‘re great for an evening with a glass of wine or for a party with friends. You will see, how quickly they disappear.

### ENJOY!
