Sufficient water drinking is very important for correct functions of the human body. Well, water build 70% of our body. It is mostly contained in cells that are reliant on regular and sufficient water receiving. That means we should hydrate our bodies carefully. You have probably already heard that people need to drink 2,5 liters of liquid drink per day, but it is individual for each body and it depends on age, weight, constitution, diet, and surrounding temperature. However dehydration may come very soon after few hours without drinking. It brings headaches, tiredness, and subsequently detoxication.

It's important to be careful what we consider beneficial fluid for the body. The ideal drink is clear water, but everybody drinks other beverages such as coffee, juices, tea, mineral waters, etc. For example coffee (what is considered the most popular beverage in the world) dewaters organism, so it is necessary to refill enough water after enjoying cup of coffee. Fans of sweet lemonades or juices should be careful. Namely sugar gives the energy, but high sugar isn't very diet culture appropriate because of high calories. Just sugar isn't that big problem as other parts. Sweet drinks contain artificial sweeteners as sodium cyclamate, also named E952, which is carcinogenic. For instance, E952 is adding in coca-cola zero. Other dangerous compounds are fabrics making the liquid the right color. It is better to remove these drinks from fluid habits. If you like mineral waters, you'd better control sodiums content. Recommended daily allowance shouldn't exceed 550 mg. The maximum acceptable content of sodium is 150 mg in 1 liter of mineral water. Extensive sodium keeps redundant water in the body and increases blood pressure. Juices are popular, a lot of people think (but by mistake) juice is healthy, but its composition doesn't make it without jet-mentioned colorants, sugar, sweeteners, and preservatives.

To sum up, clear water is the best option, and better used to drink for health benefits. Water secures the correct function of every process in an organism as thermoregulation, toxins drainage , help with digestion and regenerate all the body. Drinking a glass of water 30 minutes before the meal is highly recommended. It helps with digesting that meal.

Of course, it's possible to drink all of the beverages in an adequate amount. You know how they say, nothing must be overdone.
