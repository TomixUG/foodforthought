### About
Drinking coffee can be healthy, but it doesn’t have to be. Whilst some studies recommend its consumption as prevention against some diseases, some studies are claiming that excessive intake of this bitter black drink can cause them.  How to orientate in this chaos of contradictory information?
Whether or not is drinking coffee healthy is a common topic of many pieces of research.  Having said that, they have a common point. Out of all those research papers, there’s only one answer - that there is only a healthy amount of it and an unhealthy one. 

### Caffeine
Coffee contains caffeine. In 100 grams of coffee, there are approximately 40 milligrams of it. Despite the fact that it has stimulating effects on the central neural system, its reasonable amount is overall beneficial for your health. Caffeine even made it to the list of asthma relievers, because when you drink coffee you inhale the aromatic substances it contains. Those help relax your muscles.
From a number of studies show that the optimal consumption of coffee is 1-3 cups a day – this amount can decrease the chance of diabetes. It can also decrease the chance of Parkinson’s disease by 80%. 

### Physical Health
Whether or not does coffee and caffeine imply a risk for people with heart problems, scientists don’t really know. They are leaning towards the thesis that it is only a myth. Caffeine can in fact increase blood pressure. It cannot however increase it so extremely that people with cardiovascular problems would have to avoid it. 

### Mental health
There are also some studies claiming that drinking 1-3 cups of coffee a day can decrease the chance of depression. This has also been proven by a study issued by the Harvard University in 2011. The examined subjects showed a 20% decrease in mental illness propensity (an inclination or natural tendency to behave in a particular way). 

### To sum it up
Although all of the mention studies say that coffee is benefitial (if consumed in a reasonable amount), there are some exceptions. For example people suffering with insomnia or sleep disorders in general should be very careful with coffee. People suffering with chronic headaches and migraines should also drink coffee cautiously – caffeine can be a trigger for those. Too much caffeine can also cause anxiety in people with panic or anxiety disorders.

### Conclusion
Regardless of the numerous benefitial usages and effects of caffeine, you should still be careful with its consumption. It can be just as benefitial for your health as it can be harmful.
