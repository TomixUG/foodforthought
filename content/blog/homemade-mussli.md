Homemade müssli from real ingredients. It crunches nicely and tastes good to the whole family, keep it in a few glasses and you always have a quick breakfast and snack at hand. It is also suitable as a decoration for various baked and unbaked desserts.

### Ingredients:
- 3 large cups of flakes-oatmeal or gluten-free variant-gluten-free oatmeal, millet, rice, buckwheat, etc.
- 1 and a half cups of grated coconut
- 1 cup chopped nuts (various types)
- 1/2 cup seed mixture (hemp, chia, pumpkin, sunflower) *
- 1/2 cup melted coconut oil
- to taste 2-3 tablespoons of maple syrup, sweetener or chicory syrup, or pinch of stevia
- You can also add any: coconut chips, cocoa, dark chocolate

### Directions:
Preheat the oven to 160 ° C. Mix flakes, coconut and vanilla in a bowl. Add coconut oil and add maple syrup / sweetener / chicory syrup. Mix well so that the mixture in the oil and syrup is evenly coated. Spread the mixture on a baking sheet and put it in the oven for 10 minutes.

After 10 minutes, remove the plate, add the nuts and seeds, mix and bake in the oven for another 2 minutes. I do not put nuts and seeds (and possibly other raw ingredients) for the whole baking time, so that they do not burn and healthy fats are not destroyed by high temperatures.

Then allow to cool completely and transfer to glasses. Store in a pantry and consume in about a month.

 &#8902; I do not use flaxseed in the mixture, I grind it into the porridge fresh just before consumption. If we do not test the packaging of unground seed, our digestive tract is not able to disrupt it, so we will not get to its healthy fats and other substances. At the same time, it is not advisable to grind it in advance, because its prized fats oxidize quickly in the air and a healthy one becomes "rancid" and unhealthy. Therefore, grind the seed in a grinder or grind it in a mortar just before consumption.
