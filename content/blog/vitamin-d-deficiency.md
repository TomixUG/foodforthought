### Vitamin D, why is going outside so important?

With the state the world is in right now, it is getting progressively harder to have enough vitamin D.

But what is it really, why do we need it and how can we try and replenish it during the short days of winter?

### The main assets

As it is most widely known, vitamin D helps keep our immunity strong. Which during these trying times can be particularly important. It is advised by doctors to keep an eye on our vitamin D levels, because it can play a key role in the immune system and keep us from catching a variety of infectious viruses and bacteria. It is also very important for the absorption of Calcium, which is vital for proper bone function.

### Where do we get it?

Almost 90% of all the vitamin D we need can be absorbed from the sun. But with us being confined to our homes, it can be quite difficult to get the proper dosage. So, it is advised to also search for it elsewhere.

The most recommended way of ingesting extra vitamin D is though supplements. Because even though it can be found in some foods, like fatty fish (for example sardines) or egg yokes, we would have to eat giant portions of it each day to not need sunlight anymore.

### Are people getting enough vitamin D?

The most reliable source is still the sun. Which is not ideal for most people. Us students tend to spend pretty much the entirety of the sun’s duration indoors, adults alike. With the rise of home-office it is an even bigger issue. Plus, with the increasing amounts of UV light slipping through the cracks in our ozone, being vitamin D deprived doesn’t seem like the biggest threat. All of this led to vitamin D deficiency reaching critical numbers.

### How does it reflect on our current situation?

To put this into perspective, 60-75% of Czech people are vitamin D deficient to some degree. Which makes us more prone to catching all kinds of diseases. No particular virus comes to mind nowadays, of course.

Vitamin D deficiency also has several undesirable symptoms. Increased aggression, bone deformation, osteoporosis and a decrease in muscle function are a few of the most severe ones.

### So, what should we do?

In conclusion, we should be careful of how long we spend out in the sun. Especially if we are of pale skin, which makes us more prone to skin cancer. But that doesn’t mean it is healthy to spend all our days locked indoors. The golden middle ground and a few supplements during the cold months is the perfect solution to this problem, in my humble opinion. We should be weary of the threat UV light imposes, however not forget how important the sun is to our health.
