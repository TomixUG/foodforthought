### <u> Directions: </u>
1. Warm 180 ml of milk. It should be not hot to the touch. Add in 20 g of cane sugar and yeast. Stir and let it proof for 10 minutes, until it becomes foamy.

4. Add the mixture from step 2 and gradually add flour. The dough should be smooth and only slightly tacky to the touch.

5. Grease a large bowl with coconut oil and place the dough inside. Let the dough rise in a warm place about 1 hour, until the dough has doubled size.

8. Tightly roll dough up, make sure to seal the edges of the dough as best you can. You will probably need to cut off about an inch off the ends of the dough as the ends won’t be as full of cinnamon sugar as we’d want it to be.

10. Place cinnamon rolls in a greased baking pan or round cake pan. Cover with a towel and let rise again for 30 minutes.

13. The very best serving is when you spread the glaze over hot cinnamon rolls and eat it immediately. **ENJOY!**
