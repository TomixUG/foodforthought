## What exactly is a smoothie?
Smoothie as well as juice or milkshake is made from fruits and vegetables, but there are a few differences. In a smoothie, the main ingredient is fruit, which is blended into porridge. A smoothie can replace breakfast and even a snack. Unlike juice, it is more like the juice of fruits or vegetables and does not sow at all. And milkshake has the main ingredient milk, and the fruit is more like a flavor (so it's more of a sweetness).
## Vitamins
Smoothie is full of vitamins because it contains all the vitamins that fruit contains. But in general, it depends on the type of fruit.
## When is it best to drink a smoothie?
It depends on the composition, but in general it is a great quick breakfast or snack (morning in the case of fruit or fruit-vegetable smoothies, afternoon in the case of vegetables).
- You can also have a smoothie for lunch, but you need to have some protein (like yogurt).
- Good before sports performance - it is easy to digest
- Surely a smoothie should not be your only meal
## Does smoothie have any disadvantage?
Too much of anything is not good. it is recommended to consume 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day – the recommended ratio is 3:2 in favor of vegetables. Normally, a person would eat one banana and maybe two apples a day, but in a smoothie one can eat two bananas at once, two oranges. Depending on the composition, you can get a fairly substantial amount of calories into yourself, and in addition, fructose from fruits in larger quantities burdens the liver.
