### <u> Ingredients: </u>
- 300 g oat-flakes
- 100 g nuts (I used cashews)
- 50 g sunflower seeds
- cacao or cinnamon
- 2 spoons honey
- 50 g peanut butter

### <u> Directions: </u>

1. Preheat the oven to 175°C.
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
3. Mix all ingredients together.
4. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking sheet. If you want your granola to be clumpy, use a spatula to press it onto the baking sheet.
5. Bake it for 20 minutes. Stir it halfway through. The granola is ready when golden-brown and the nuts have toasted.
6. Remove from the oven. Then you can add lyophilized fruit or chocolate chips. You can serve granola with yoghurt, milk, in a smoothie bowl or just alone. Enjoy!
