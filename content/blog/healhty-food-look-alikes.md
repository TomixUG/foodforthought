We all know that mayonnaise, fries and similar delicacies are like a time bomb to our body. But what about soy or dried fruit?

While with chips or barbecue sauce it is completely useless to argue about how little is too much and how much is too much, because unhealthy is just any amount, for potatoes or dried apricots it is not so clear.

### Sulfite flavored fruit
Bananas, mangoes, pineapples or papaya are all tropical fruits that contain a lot of sugar, so we should only consume it occasionally and in reasonable quantities (one serving a day is enough). We should not overdo it with dried fruit either.

### Potatoes stuffed with starch
Do you have a good portion of potatoes for lunch? Then you'd better take it off. Vegetables high in starch contain too much energy, which will break blood sugar levels. Unlike vegetables with a low starch content (broccoli, spinach, green pepper, etc.), potatoes contain little antioxidants and other important nutrients, so consuming them (apart from excess calories) will not give you much extra.

If you do not want to give up the side dishes, at least try to replace potatoes with species that are beneficial - such as beets (protects against heart attacks), sweet potatoes (they hide a lot of vitamin C and substances that inhibit free radicals) or parsnips (prevents the development of tumors).

### Soybean with estrogen
Soy has long been one of the so-called superfoods. Its regular consumption was also recommended for menopausal women to alleviate menopausal symptoms. It contains isoflavonoids, which are substances that work on the principle of the female hormones estrogen. There has been a lot of talk about them in connection with breast cancer, which they allegedly helped to suppress.

Recent research, however, has shown that they can be very undesirable in menopausal women (or those who have a predisposition to develop cancer). Isoflavonoids (like estrogens) stimulate abnormal cell growth. Many soy products are also made from genetically modified beans, the effects of which on human health are not yet well known.

### Hungry "bloated nothing"
Many people in an effort to lose weight replace ordinary bread with rice breads or corn sandwiches. They look so healthy after all, and it's so "bloated," so you can indulge in them. Do you really think so? Then I will disappoint you. The opposite is true.

These seemingly innocent goodies have a high glycemic index (that is, the rate at which sugar is absorbed into the body from a given food) and are quickly converted into fat stores. So definitely don't overdo it with them, or at least always have a piece of ham, eggs, cheese, cottage cheese or vegetables with them.

### Light products full of chemistry
A popular trend of chronic dieticians are products marked with the magic word "light". That sounds nice, but even these foods carry certain risks. Although they have a reduced energy value (less fat or sugar), they often contain large amounts of synthetic substances, which in turn increase energy intake (such as thickeners).

In addition, these components are completely unidentifiable for our body. The body simply does not know what to do with them and where to place them. And so he eventually sends them straight to the fat supply.

Happy healthy existing!
