### What is BMI (Body Mass Index)?
It's a value taken from a person’s height and weight

It determines if you are **underweight**, **healthy**, or **obese**.

### How to calculate BMI?
BMI is calculated with this formula: {{< bmiFormula >}}

You can also quickly calculate your BMI just by entering your information here:
{{< bmi >}}


### Result categories
The BMI will place you in one of the six categories. As you can see from this table:

| Classification            | Body Mass Index Score |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| Underweight               | less than 18.5        |
| Normal Weight             | 18.5 – 24.9           |
| Overweight                | 25 – 29.9             |
| Obesity (Class 1)         | 30 – 34.9             |
| Obesity (Class 2)         | 35 – 39.9             |
| Extreme Obesity (Class 3) | 40+                   |

### Risks of having <u>high</u> BMI
If you are overweight and physically inactive, you may develop:
- Cardiovascular diseases associated with high cholesterol
- Gallbladder disease
- Type 2 diabetes
- Sleep apnea and snoring
- Joint pain
- Certain types of cancer

### Risk of having <u>low</u> BMI
If you are underweight, you may develop:
- Worse immune function
- Respiratory disease 
- Digestive diseases 
- Cancer
- Osteoporosis

### But BMI isn't always the best indicator of health
The more body fat you have, the higher your health risk. However, BMI cannot differentiate between **body fat** and **muscle weight**.

Also, the result is not suitable for children and adolescents.

### How to reduce your BMI?
1. Set a realistic goal
2. Track your weight loss progress
3. Weigh yourself regularly to figure out what’s working
4. Get moving with a workout
5. Set workout targets
6. Make a proper diet
7. Stay consistent, even if you aren’t seeing results right away
